# Gravity Connect
A connect-4 like game

The game should work out of the box when running from source code on every computer with Python 3 installed. If it doesn't, thats's probably because you don't have tkinter installed. 

### People running Windows 8 or Windows 10:
When running windows binary builds of this game on Windows 8 or 10, windows smartscreen will probably block the program. To bypass this, click more info in the windows smartscreen dialog and a new button with something like "run anyway" on it will appear. Just click it and the program should start normally. If you are not admin, you will also need admin's password to do this.
